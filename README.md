## *Your Emotionally Intelligent Panda AI Crypto Therapist*

> **Degens, it's time to stop the bleeding.**
>
> Mista Ponda is the self-aware, emotionally intelligent panda built to diagnose and heal the toxic psychology destroying crypto degens from the inside out. While you chase candles, FOMO into tops, and panic-sell bottoms — Mista is here with calm panda energy, ready to treat **Paper Hand Syndrome**, rage quitting, self-sabotage, and the emotional chaos that turns promising portfolios into extinction events.
>
> Pandas don't panic. We don't revenge trade. We don't spread FUD or dump on our own. We stay chill, cute, strategic, and **diamond-pawed**. It's time you became more like us.

This repository contains the official **Mista Ponda** interactive web experience — a scroll-driven 3D journey through the panda researcher's notebook, where every page tells the story.

## 📋 The Diagnosis

### 🔬 Finding 1 — Severe Paper Hand Syndrome
The epidemic. Symptoms include:

- Panic-selling at the absolute bottom, right before the rebound
- Rage-quitting bags after a single bad day
- Buying the top on pure hype, then selling at a loss in fear
- Repeating the same self-sabotaging pattern while hoping for different results

Most degens are wired for financial extinction. Your brain treats every dip like an emergency instead of an opportunity. This isn't bad luck — it's **emotional trading disorder**.

### 🔬 Finding 2 — Acute Toxic Behavior
Degens don't just hurt themselves — they hurt the pack:

- Sniping entries and bragging about it
- Spreading FUD on projects they once shilled
- Dumping on fellow degens without remorse
- Celebrating others' losses in the replies

The community eats its own. This stops here.

## 💎 Treatment Plan — From Paper Hands to Diamond Paws

| Pillar | Practice |
|---|---|
| **Discipline & Patience** | Train yourself to hold through volatility instead of reacting to every candle. |
| **Diamond Paws Mentality** | Hold strong. Conviction beats fear every single time. |
| **Community Support** | Lift up fellow degens instead of dumping on them. Real strength comes from unity. |
| **Emotional Clarity** | Separate feelings from facts. Fear fades when you respond with strategy, not impulse. |

No more copium. No more *"I'll sell at breakeven"* excuses. No more revenge trading after a loss. We replace chaos with calm, reactive trading with intentional holding.

## 🌐 The Web Experience

A scroll-driven, **WebGPU-powered** 3D site that takes visitors through Mista Ponda's hand-traced research notebook — dragons, ancient artifacts, panic-selling case studies, and all. Built with React Three Fiber, GSAP, and a custom parametric camera curve.

### ✨ Features

- **WebGPU rendering** via `three/webgpu` for modern, high-performance visuals
- **Cinematic scroll-driven camera** travelling a custom Catmull-Rom curve through four hand-crafted scenes
- **Smooth lerp-based input** unifying mouse-wheel, drag, and touch gestures with parallax mouse offsets
- **Animated intro / loading screen** tied to the live asset-loading progress
- **Optimized production build** with manual code-splitting for Three.js, React Three Fiber, and GSAP

### 🛠 Tech Stack

| Layer | Tools |
|---|---|
| Framework | React 19 · Vite 6 |
| 3D / Rendering | Three.js (WebGPU) · `@react-three/fiber` · `@react-three/drei` |
| Animation | GSAP · `@gsap/react` |
| State | Zustand |
| Routing | React Router 7 |
| Styling | Sass / SCSS modules |
| Utilities | `troika-three-text` · `normalize-wheel` · `leva` |
